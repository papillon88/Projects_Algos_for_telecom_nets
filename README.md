# Projects_Algos_for_telecom_nets

This repo contains the projects I did as a part of my coursework in Algorithmic aspects of telecommunication network.

### Implementation of Nagamochi and Ibaraki algorithm
Implemented using python,gephi and networkX package for python. Showed variation of critical edges in a graph v/s node degree AND graph connectivity v/s average node degree. [Report available here](https://github.com/papillon88/Projects_Algos_for_telecom_nets/blob/master/Projects_Algos_for_telecom_nets/ATN_Project_2_Debaspreet_Chowdhury.pdf).  

### Study in the dependence of overall network reliability on individual link reliabilities
Implemented using python,gephi and networkX package for python. Showed variation of network reliability v/s individual link reliabilities and network rel v/s random number of link flips. [Report available here](https://github.com/papillon88/Projects_Algos_for_telecom_nets/blob/master/Projects_Algos_for_telecom_nets/ATN_Project_3_Debaspreet_Chowdhury.pdf).
